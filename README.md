## Project Overview

This is a simple Node.js application designed for CICD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) testing purposes.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (version 14.x or newer recommended)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)
- Git (for cloning the repository)

---

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shazforiot/nodeapp_test.git
   cd nodeapp_test
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

---

## Running the Application

You can start the application using npm:

```bash
npm start
```

By default, this runs `node index.js`. Ensure you have an `index.js` in your project root.

---

## Testing the Application

There is a test script defined, which appears to use Mocha:

```bash
npm test
```

This runs Mocha with the entry point at `.test/test.js`. Make sure Mocha is installed (it's included as a dev dependency).

---

## Project Structure

- `index.js` - Entry point of the application.
- `package.json` - Project configuration, scripts, and dependencies.
- `node_modules/` - Installed dependencies.
- `test/` - Contains test files (e.g., `test.js`).
- Other files as needed for your application.

---

## Scripts

Defined in `package.json`:

- **start**: `node index.js`  
  Starts the application.
- **test**: `./node_modules/.bin/mocha ./test/test.js`  
  Runs tests using Mocha.

---

## Dependencies

- **express**: ^4.17.1

## Development Dependencies

- **mocha**: ^9.1.1
- **supertest**: ^6.1.6

---

## Additional Notes

- Update your `index.js` and `test/test.js` files as per your application logic.
- For CI/CD integration, configure your workflow files (e.g., GitHub Actions) as needed.
